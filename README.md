# 🚀 Jarles Lekekasse 🚀

Welcome to my playground! Here, you'll find the knowledge I've gathered from various courses related to machine learning, data manipulation, web scraping, and application testing. I've used a range of Python libraries, dabbled in web scraping, and played around with seasonal adjustments.

## 📊 Cobb-Douglas Cost and Production Functions Shiny App 📊

Get hands-on with economics! 🖐️ My Shiny application allows you to explore Cobb-Douglas cost and production functions interactively. You can adjust parameters like the fixed costs, scale parameter, labor price, and capital price to your heart's content! The application then generates a lovely graph 📈 of the cost function and calculates the total cost based on your inputs.
