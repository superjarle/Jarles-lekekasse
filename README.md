# 🚀 Jarles Lekekasse 🚀

Welcome to my playground! Here, you'll find the knowledge I've gathered from various courses related to machine learning, data manipulation, web scraping, and application testing. I've used a range of Python libraries, dabbled in web scraping, and played around with seasonal adjustments.

## 📊 [Cobb-Douglas Cost Functions Shiny App](https://superjarle.shinyapps.io/cobb-douglas-econ/) 📊

Get hands-on with economics! 🖐️ My Shiny application allows you to interactively explore Cobb-Douglas cost functions. You can adjust parameters like the fixed costs, scale parameter, price of labor, and price of capital to your heart's content! The application then generates a lovely graph 📈 of the cost function and calculates the total cost based on your inputs.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Course 🤖

I've successfully completed the "Elements in Machine Learning" course at DataCamp. This course provided an introduction to machine learning concepts, including various types of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and model evaluation.
